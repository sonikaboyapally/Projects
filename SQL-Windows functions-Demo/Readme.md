The SQL queries do the following:

  -create a table coder_performance with details like coder_id(i used names though), department, accuracy 
  
  -show the table just to make sure every thing is correct
  
  -use windows function to learn the average accuracy of a coder for a particular department
  
  -use windows function to partition by department, sort by accuracy, identify the coder with highest & least accuracy and to find out the range of accuracy values.
